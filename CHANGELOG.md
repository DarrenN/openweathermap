### Changed
- Replaced placeholder OpenAPI file with reusable components for parameters, shared weather schemas, and standard error responses.
- Updated bootstrap plan to mark Phase 1 complete and Phase 2 draft/spec-capture items complete.
- Switched `make spec-check` from `swagger-cli` to Redocly CLI (`redocly lint spec/*.yaml`).
- Updated `README.org` prerequisites and setup instructions to include Redocly CLI installation via `npm install`.
- Added `info.license` metadata to OpenAPI spec to satisfy Redocly recommended rules.
- Updated core ASDF system dependencies to include `dexador` (HTTP) and `jonathan` (JSON).
- Expanded `README.org` with public API usage examples for fetch/build functions and runtime configuration.
- Renamed package and ASDF systems from `openweathermap-onecall*` to `openweathermap*` (breaking rename; no compatibility aliases).
- Updated Makefile, tests, and source namespaces to the new `openweathermap` package identity.
- Standardized multi-API public naming with `build-*`, `make-*`, and `fetch-*` functions across API families.
- Updated system definition to load API-family modules from `src/apis/`.
- Updated `README.org` with API surface conventions and module layout guidance.
- Updated unit test system definition to include `tests/current-test.lisp`.
- Updated unit test system definition to include `tests/forecast-test.lisp`.
- Updated unit test system definition to include `tests/geocoding-test.lisp`.
- Updated unit test system definition to include `tests/air-pollution-test.lisp`.
- Updated unit test system definition to include `tests/maps-test.lisp`.
- Updated integration ASDF definition to load helper modules.
- Added Makefile integration smoke targets per API family:
  - `integration-onecall`
  - `integration-current`
  - `integration-forecast`
  - `integration-geocoding`
  - `integration-air-pollution`
  - `integration-maps`
- Integration runs are now explicitly env-gated by `OPENWEATHERMAP_RUN_LIVE_TESTS` in addition to `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
- Integration suite runner now prints detailed FiveAM failure diagnostics (`explain!`) before raising an error, so live test failures are debuggable from CLI logs.
- Improved REPL startup workflow in `Makefile`:
  - `make repl` now loads `:openweathermap` and switches package context.
  - added `make repl-tests` and `make repl-integration` targets for test-focused sessions.
- Request execution now treats only HTTP `200 OK` as success for fetch operations; any non-200 response signals request failure (including integration runs).
- Fixed weather tile layer normalization for keyword inputs (e.g., `:temp_new` now serializes correctly instead of `emp_new`).
- Added query-parameter conformance tests in `tests/query-param-conformance-test.lisp` to validate exact query key sets across generated URLs for One Call, Current, Forecast, Geocoding, Air Pollution, and Maps.
- Expanded query-parameter conformance coverage to include required-vs-optional combinations for all implemented URL builders (One Call family, Current, Forecast, Geocoding direct/reverse/zip, Air Pollution current/forecast/history, and Maps).
- Query-parameter conformance tests now assert percent-encoding of special characters in query values (spaces, commas, plus sign/colon timezone values, and forward slash in palette values).
- Added starter runnable examples under `examples/`:
  - `01-build-urls.lisp`
  - `02-current-weather-fetch.lisp`
  - `03-geocoding-fetch.lisp`
  - `04-maps-tile-fetch.lisp`
  - shared loader: `examples/common-loader.lisp`
  - docs: `examples/README.org`
- Added two additional examples:
  - `05-all-apis.lisp` (single script touching all implemented API families)
  - `06-repl-workflow.lisp` (REPL helper workflow for interactive development)
- Updated examples docs to include interactive REPL loading via `sbcl --load`.
- Refactored all `fetch-*` functions to execute their corresponding `make-*` request descriptors, ensuring a single request-construction path.
- Added missing docstrings across internal and public functions in `src/client.lisp` and `src/apis/*.lisp`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with current repository structure, canonical commands, and URL/query safety checklist for future agent handoff.
- Expanded `README.org` with parameter documentation tables and a draft response-type reference table across all supported API families.
- Added Phase G1 weather condition mapping scaffolding:
  - updater script `scripts/update-weather-conditions.mjs`
  - generated dataset schema `data/weather-conditions.schema.json`
  - generated dataset `data/weather-conditions.json`
  - generated Lisp constants `src/data/weather-conditions.lisp`
  - Make target `make update-weather-conditions`
  - README/AGENTS docs updates for the new workflow
- Added Phase G2 weather-condition helper API in `src/weather-conditions.lisp`:
  - `lookup-weather-condition`
  - `weather-icon-url`
  - `resolve-weather-condition`
  - `enrich-weather-entry`
  - `enrich-weather-list`
- Updated ASDF load order to include generated weather-condition data module.
- Added targeted unit tests for weather-condition helpers in `tests/weather-conditions-test.lisp`.
- Expanded weather-condition helper test coverage for Phase G3:
  - known-ID sample assertions (200/500/800/804)
  - icon URL input validation failure cases
  - canonical fallback behavior when payload fields are missing
  - full catalog icon conformance check against supported icon set
- Documented weather-condition helper API in `README.org` with signatures, return behavior, and examples.
- Added weather-condition examples:
  - `examples/07-weather-condition-helpers.lisp` (offline helper walkthrough)
  - `examples/08-current-weather-enrichment.lisp` (live current-weather enrichment flow)
- Updated `examples/README.org` with commands for the new scripts.
- Fixed `examples/08-current-weather-enrichment.lisp` key extraction to use case-insensitive plist lookup and added explicit error output when the weather list is missing.
- Completed Phase G4 documentation/examples pass:
  - added weather helper API docs and runnable demo pointers in `README.org`
  - expanded `examples/README.org` with helper example descriptions
- Hardened Phase G1 updater implementation:
  - switched from static in-script tables to parse-driven extraction from upstream weather-condition HTML
  - added strict source validation and sentinel checks before accepting a source
  - improved per-source error reporting when parsing fails
- Expanded OpenAPI specs from stubs to concrete path/parameter/response/schema definitions for:
  - `spec/current.yaml`
  - `spec/forecast.yaml`
  - `spec/geocoding.yaml`
  - `spec/air-pollution.yaml`
  - `spec/maps.yaml`
- Tightened current/forecast fetch mode behavior:
  - `fetch-current-weather` and `fetch-forecast` now reject non-JSON `mode` values with `invalid-parameters-error`.
  - `build-*` and `make-*` helpers still allow building non-JSON mode requests.
- Added strict weather maps layer allowlist validation in `build-weather-tile-url` based on documented layer set.
- Added/updated unit tests for non-JSON mode rejection and invalid map layer rejection.
- Tightened location-selector validation for current/forecast URL builders:
  - exactly one selector must be provided (`lat/lon` pair, `q`, `id`, or `zip`)
  - partial coordinates (`lat` without `lon`, or `lon` without `lat`) are now rejected locally.
- Added parameter bound validation:
  - forecast `:cnt` must be an integer in `1..40`
  - geocoding and reverse-geocoding `:limit` must be an integer in `1..5`.
- Expanded unit tests for selector exclusivity/coordinate pairing and `:cnt`/`:limit` bounds.
- Added a stabilization plan document for ergonomics and contract hardening:
  - `plans/2026-02-16-ergonomics-and-contract-stabilization-plan.md`
- Stabilized One Call-family request contracts in `src/client.lisp`:
  - added required positional input validation for onecall/timemachine/day-summary/overview URL builders
  - added strict even-length query plist validation for dynamic query params
  - normalized decoded JSON object keys to keyword symbols for consistent `getf` access.
- Expanded tests for stabilized contract behavior:
  - One Call builder required-parameter validation and odd query-plist rejection
  - weather-tile odd query-plist rejection
  - JSON-key normalization assertions across One Call, Current, Forecast, Geocoding, and Air Pollution unit tests.
- Updated examples and integration smoke checks to use normalized key access patterns (`:name`, `:list`, etc.) without escaped-key fallbacks.
- Updated README response-type notes to document normalized decoded key behavior.
- Phase 2 ergonomics improvements:
  - exported condition-reader accessors:
    - `api-request-error-status-code`
    - `api-request-error-message`
    - `api-request-error-endpoint`
    - `invalid-parameters-error-message`
  - added `make-onecall-request` as preferred alias for `make-client-weather-request` (compatibility name retained).
  - added reader/alias unit test coverage in `tests/client-test.lisp`.
  - documented One Call request-builder alias in `README.org`.
  - added per-client configuration model evaluation note:
    - `plans/2026-02-16-phase2-client-model-evaluation.md`
- Phase 3 documentation and usability pass:
  - added a consumer-first quickstart section in `README.org` with load/configure/first-call flow
  - added explicit `Error Handling` section with `handler-case` examples and accessor usage
  - added `Contract Notes` clarifying normalized key usage and local validation behavior
  - aligned documentation with stabilized response contract and One Call builder validation rules
  - verified runnable examples:
    - offline: `examples/01-build-urls.lisp`, `examples/06-repl-workflow.lisp`, `examples/07-weather-condition-helpers.lisp`
    - live (with API key): `examples/02-current-weather-fetch.lisp`, `examples/03-geocoding-fetch.lisp`, `examples/04-maps-tile-fetch.lisp`, `examples/05-all-apis.lisp`, `examples/08-current-weather-enrichment.lisp`

### Notes
- Redocly validation passes in this environment; current Node (`v20.10.0`) shows a runtime version warning from Redocly, which recommends `>=20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`.
