* OpenWeatherMap OneCall API Client

Common Lisp client library for the OpenWeatherMap One Call 3.0 API.

** Status
This repository is in early bootstrap.

** Goals
- Idiomatic Common Lisp client interface.
- Strong unit test suite.
- Separate integration test suite for live API checks.
- Project-local OpenAPI specification for One Call 3.0.

** Quick Start
*** Prerequisites
- SBCL
- ASDF
- Quicklisp (for external dependencies such as FiveAM)

*** Run unit tests
#+begin_src sh
make unit
#+end_src

*** Run integration tests
Set your API key first:
#+begin_src sh
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your-key"
make integration
#+end_src

** Development Workflow
- Use =make check= for local quality checks.
- Keep implementation in =src/=.
- Keep unit tests in =tests/=.
- Keep live API integration tests in =integration-tests/=.
- Keep plans in =plans/=.
- Keep API spec in =spec/openapi.yaml=.
- Update =CHANGELOG.md= for each session.
